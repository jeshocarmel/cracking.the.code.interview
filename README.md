# Go solutions for Cracking The Code Interview questions

  

This repository contains answers to the infamous [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) book by **Gayle Laakmann McDowell**. For those who don't know what this book is about, think of it as the bible for software developers who appear for interviews in top tier companies. 
  

#### Instructions: 
1. Each Go file has an associated test file in the same folder.

	e.g. ```peaksandvalleys.go``` and ```peaksandvalleys_test.go``` 			represent the solution to a question and it's respective test cases.

	To run all tests , run 	```go test -v```  in your terminal.
	To run a single test, run  ```go test -v -run TestFizzBuzz```  where *TestFizzBuzz* is the name of a test case in one of the test files.

 
2. Chapter 13, which is JAVA based has solutions in JAVA language. No test cases are included as each file it's own main method.

3. Advanced directory has implementations of topics (e.g. Rabin-Karb search) included in the Advanced Topics section.

Good luck interviewing :)
